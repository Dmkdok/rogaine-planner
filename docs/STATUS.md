## Test report

`docker compose run --rm tests` — **87 passed**, exit 0 (2026-08-19). `ruff check .` clean.
Image verified to carry `tesseract 5.5.0` and `cv2 5.0.0`; `docker compose run --rm app` prints the
CLI help. Never run pytest on the Windows host — it hangs.

Three real defects were found by this first run and fixed:

1. `Route._legs_match_order` zipped `order` with `order[1:]` under `strict=True`. Those are always
   one apart, so **every valid route was rejected** with `zip() argument 2 is shorter than
   argument 1`. The inner zip is ragged on purpose; only the outer one may be strict.
2. `_place_controls` in the fixture returned a hub and nothing else when the map was too small for
   the 5-radii minimum gap (a 400x300 map at 300 dpi placed **0 of 6** controls). Silent
   under-placement would have made every downstream control assertion pass by vacuum; it now
   raises with the numbers in the message.
3. The fixture drew a fixed 26 contour lines regardless of map height, so a small map came out
   almost solid brown. The count now scales with height; the standard 1200 px fixture keeps its 26.

## What M0 landed

- `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile` (base + test stages), `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`,
  `.gitignore`. Ruff is configured in `pyproject.toml`, not a separate `ruff.toml`.
- `src/rogaine/models.py` — the contract, **frozen** (ADR-008). pydantic for what serialises,
  frozen dataclasses for what carries numpy.
- `config/default.toml` + `src/rogaine/config.py` — ISOM inks and shades from IOF Appendix 1,
  the 17-class terrain table, and `cmyk_to_srgb` built on process-ink primaries.
- `tests/fixtures/synth_map.py` — the synthetic ISOM map with exact ground truth, plus the
  `FULL_SIZE` 4000x3000 preset the performance budgets are stated against.
- `src/rogaine/io/corpus.py` + `src/rogaine/cli.py` — corpus intake and `rogaine corpus
  list` / `check`. The CLI is a stub that T050 (WS-C) extends, not replaces.
- `data/README.md` — the on-disk contract for the owner's maps.
- `tools/ocd_render.md` + `tools/ocd_render.py` — the T006 spike, closed as
  documented-not-executed (no `.ocd` file has arrived).

## Two decisions worth keeping in view

- **`cmyk_to_srgb` does not use the textbook formula.** The naive conversion renders ISOM purple
  (35/85/0/0) with a blue channel of 255, which would put the control circles nearer to blue than
  to purple and break T020 before it started. The conversion interpolates towards measured process
  ink primaries instead. `test_isom_purple_is_purple_not_blue` is the guard.
- **`palette.lab_distance_threshold = 35.0` is provisional.** The shade table is derived from
  published CMYK, so it sits a real distance from what any given map prints — largest for green.
  T013 sets it from measured distances; T017 confirms it against the real corpus. If a fixed
  palette proves brittle, fit it per map (cluster the map's own colours in Lab) rather than widening
  the threshold until `unknown` stops meaning anything.

## Blocked on the owner

None of these block M1 — the synthetic fixture carries it — but M0's T005/T006 and all of T017
stay half-open until they arrive:

- the path to the map corpus, to be laid out under `data/maps/` per `data/README.md`;
- whether OCAD itself is available, or OpenOrienteering Mapper should be installed for T006;
- **one map with a reference route** (`reference.json`) — this is the acceptance oracle and the
  single most valuable item on the list;
- a controls list with points for that map;
- the scan DPI and map scale.

## Notes
- Source of the idea: https://habr.com/ru/articles/1065342/ (rogaine route optimisation:
  SegFormer segmentation, VLM control detection, A* + Held-Karp).
- Owner decisions taken during elicitation (2026-08-18):
  - Success = route quality equal to or better than the article's; method is free.
  - Inputs on disk: map rasters (PNG/JPG/PDF/scan) plus a few `.ocd` files. On 2026-08-19 the owner
    offered 200+ scans and further help; roles and sizing settled in ADR-010, tasks T005/T006/T017.
  - Control detection: CV plus manual correction. No VLM.
  - Delivery: CLI plus a local web viewer.
  - Scale: 30-80 controls, heuristic solver acceptable, exact solver kept as the oracle.
  - Map scale: manual entry plus calibration line.
  - Movement model: base speed x terrain coefficient + contour-based slope penalty.
  - Rules: start = finish, points penalty per minute late.
  - Georeferencing/GPX: out of scope.
  - Acceptance: solver self-check (heuristic vs exact gap) plus the owner's own judgement.
- Environment probed: Windows 11, Python 3.14.3 host, Docker 29.3.1 / Compose v5.1.1,
  NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB, git 2.55.0. Docker Desktop needs starting manually after a reboot.
- Serena project `map-planer` created and activated at `E:\Dev\_AI_\map-planer`.
- Next action: M1 (WS-A vision, T010-T017) — raster loading, scale, normalisation, then the
  palette classifier that everything downstream depends on.
